# Embedded-RoadMap
Welcome To My Embedded Road-Map, I Made This Road-Map To Help Any One To Start Studying Embedded System And Providing Him All Sources He Will Need

## RoadMap Level
In This RoadMap I Made Three Levels :
- Level A (The Beginning)
- Level B (Go deeper)
- Leve C (Mastering)

## Level A (The Beginning)
In This Level You Will Study Software Basic That Help You To Start At Embedded System

### 1- C Programming
You Will Study This Topic Hardly Because That Is The Important Topic In Embedded

#### Week 1 (C Basic) :
You Can Study This Weak From ([Video 1 - 16](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfgCIULRQavzxY))

In This Weak You Should To Know 
- Program structure - Compiling a C program - Type of errors
- Variables Types - Declartion Vs Definition - Constants , Qualifiers
- printf & scanf - Escape sequence characters - Specifiers
- operators - conversion
- Program execution flow chart - Condition â€“ Looping

#### Week 2 (Functions & Scope & Memory) :
You Can Study This Weak From ([Video 17 - 23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV_Cu2iJNRQ&list=PLfgCIULRQavzxY-IO2sO5Vj5x7C_tjW3R&index=17&pp=iAQB))
